## Features

- uses HAR format
- supports JSON, YAML, XML, HTML output
- plays nice with proxies (uses the X-Forwarded-* headers for IP resolution)
- allows for HTTP Method Override using the header `X-HTTP-Method-Override` or through query string parameter: `_method`
- create custom bins for experimenting log collection

## Installation

```shell
npm install httpconsole
```

After installing the `npm` package you can now start the server like so:

```shell
npm start
```
By Default the server will run on port `8080`, you can customize the port like so: 

```shell
npm config set httpconsole:port 8001
```

**note**: in environments such as Heroku, the port which the server is running on, is forwarded to another, by default the application will use the port defined above in all responses (e.g. redirects), if you wish to use a masked port, set the following config:

```shell
npm config set httpconsole:port_mask 80
```
